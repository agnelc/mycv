WHO AM I?

I am an individual. I am my own person; a person who makes mistakes, laughs, cries, hurts, smiles and loves. I am who I am through my joys, sorrows, heartbreaks, happiness and my loses. Each step in my life and each moment that goes by makes me up as an individual person. Every experience in my life good or bad, happy or sad makes me stronger.
Each passing moment is a new life experience for me and makes me grow into the person I want to be. Day by day, hour by hour I take a new step in my life, a step towards another, into a world full of knowledge. Knowledge is all around me, waiting for me to learn new things and process new information that will teach me through life. I am a student throughout life, not just in the classroom.
